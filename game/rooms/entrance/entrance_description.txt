You come out into the room and see what looks like a front door.
It has windows on either side but they are borded up and imposible to see out of.
You try the door but find the handle doesn't even move. 
You look around and see a skeleton curled up in the corner with a sword next to it.
On the left side of the room you see a door with whiring sounds behind it like a machine is running.
On the right you see a steal door that has a sign on the top that reads control room.
What will you do?
