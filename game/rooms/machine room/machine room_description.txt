You open the door and see a tall room with a strange machine.
The whiring that you heard before becomes a roar as soon as you open the door.
The machine is tall, with lots of spinning components. 
It also has components that seem to disapear and reapear just like the distorted men.
You also see a strange device that you can't identify the purpose of, but it looks rather important.
What would you like to do?
