You open the door and step out into the corridor.
As you take your first step a plume of dust kicks up. 
There are faded pictures all over the walls on top of pealing wallpaper.
You look around and see a door on the left wall. 
You also see a bat leaning on a dusty end table with a helmet sitting on top.
Past that you see a right turn into another hallway.
What will you do?
