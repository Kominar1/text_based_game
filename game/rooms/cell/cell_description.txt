You open the door and you see cell bars across half of the room. 
There is a desk shoved against one of the walls with a gun on top of it.
You look in the left side and you see an ever shifting entity.
As you look at it you see the arms stretch out and shrink.
It's torso stretches out and elongates and then shrinks again. 
Where it's face should be is just smooth skin except for a much to wide mouth. 
The mouth is on wrong though, going from chin to the top of it's head. 
You grab your head, looking at it is causing such a headache.
